# Keep a tally

This is a demo project to play with and learn about Firebase.

## Development

This project is built using Firebase, React and Webpack (among other things).

To work locally, you can just run `npm run dev`.

This will:

* Run webpack with a watcher (`webpack --progress --colors --watch`)
* Run `firebase serve`
